# ElementsAssignment  
This is an assignment which has majorly 2 important functionality  
1.) Fetching the list of cities and it's details.  
2.) Showing the detail of the city and weather details when user clicks on particular city.  
  
# Components and tools used
1.) MVVM  
2.) Kotlin  
3.) Dagger for Dependency injection  
4.) Extension functions  
5.) Navigation graph  
6.) Android X components  
7.) Versions.Gradle file  
8.) Unit test cases.  
9.) UI test cases.  
10.) Room DB  
11.) Retrofit  
12.) Glide  
13.) Android kotlin extension plugin for binding view ids  
14.) Used region to segregate the file functions  
15.) Made sure to implement the comments wherever possible.  

# User stories implemented
1.) As a Reviewer, I want an mobile application that can show the weather data that is supplied by my server: (https://us-central1-mobile-assignment-server.
cloudfunctions.net/weather).  
2.) As a User, I want to see a home screen with all the cities that are available on the API.  
3.) As a User, I want the cities be sorted alphabetically.  
4.) As a User, I want to be able to refresh the data that is on the home screen.  
5.) As a User, I want to be able to click on a city and see the weather results on a separate screen.  
6.) As a User, I want all the temperatures to be displayed in Celsius. The API returns also Fahrenheit and Kelvin, so they need to be converted:  
Celsius = Kelvin - 273.15    
Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) / 1.8  
7.) As a Reviewer, I want a subject in the README.md explaining the chosen architecture.  
8.) As a Reviewer, I want the application to be offline-first. The data must be fetched from the API and must be stored in a database. If there is no internet the 
data from the database must be used.  
9.) As a Reviewer, I want the application delivered in a zipped Git repo. The Git repo may not be published to a public location.  
10.) As a Reviewer, I want the application only to be optimized for mobile devices and in Portrait mode.  
11.) As a Reviewer, I want a report of User Stories that couldn't be finished or have a comment. Please add it to the README.md of your project
12.) As a User, I want the temperatures to be displayed in chronological order.  
13.) As a Reviewer, I want the app to support a minimum SDK version of 21 and target + compile with the latest SDK version.    
14.) As a Reviewer, I value the usage of Kotlin over Java. If there is a reason for writing Java, please specify it in the README.md.
